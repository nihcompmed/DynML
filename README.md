# DynML: Dynamical System Machine Learning

DynML is a multiplexed ensemble reservoir computing framework that explicitly leverages chaotic dynamics as a computational resource. The method links topological entropy to predictive performance, providing a principled design criterion for reservoir selection in nonlinear and biological time-series learning.
